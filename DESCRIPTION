Package: rtopojson
Title: Tools for working with data written in the TopoJSON specification
Description: This package may be used to parse polygon data written in the
    TopoJSON specification.  With it, you can open a TopoJSON file, convert
    it from relative to absolute coordinates, create 'sp' SpatialPolygon
    objects from it, and plot polygons from it.
    For more on the advantages of the TopoJSON specification see the wiki:
